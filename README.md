# What is it?

A multimodal german tutor is meant to be an 'experimental' dialog game which teaches you german in a gamified manner. This project should not be taken seriously since its meant to be a fun exploration into games, RL and multimodal language models.

## Example
An example scenario is where the player is asked to fulfill an objective by conversing in german:
```
Order an espresso with two packets of sugar
``` 
Then the player converses with barista person in german to accomplish the objective:
```
Barista> Hallo wie geht es dir!
Player> Alles gut! und du?
Barista> Ich Auch! was möchten sie?
Player> Ich möchte ein espresso mit zwei zucker bitte.
Barista> das ist alles
Player> Ja
Barista> perfekt
```
